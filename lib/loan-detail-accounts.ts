/**
 * Which revenue accounts a loan is expected to carry, and what counts as its
 * net result.
 *
 * ─── THE COLUMN RULE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A branch earns its margin through different accounts depending on whether it
 * is corporate:
 *
 *   branch 700 (corporate) : DM Margin, RM Margin
 *   every other branch     : Back-end Margin, Front-end Margin, Discount Income
 *
 * RM Margin belongs to 700. The 28 rows sitting on branch 724 are margin 724
 * earns on loans that branch 703 brought in — real revenue for 724, but not
 * revenue from 724's own loans, and this view only ever looks at the loans a
 * branch produces. 724 has its own P&L besides: 773 rows, 30 loans.
 *
 * The rule is a default, not a filter. Measured 2026-08-12, every account
 * appears on both sides of it:
 *
 *   DM Margin        334 in 700 /   3 outside
 *   RM Margin         13 in 700 /  33 outside
 *   Back-end Margin    4 in 700 / 296 outside
 *   Front-end Margin   3 in 700 / 274 outside
 *   Discount Income    3 in 700 / 258 outside
 *
 * So an amount in an account the branch does not "own" is common, not exotic.
 * It is always shown — as an extra column with an amber header — never hidden
 * and never folded silently into a total.
